# -Probability-Prediction-of-Car-Insurance-Claim
# The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that assesses the probability of a claim being filed for car insurance policies. By identifying the factors that influence claim frequency and severity over a six-month period, this model enables insurance companies to:

# 1. Better assess risk profiles for potential and current policyholders.

# 2. Determine appropriate and competitive premiums.
